    Project Polygon
</h1>

<br>

This is a FOSS release of the source code for the Project Polygon website, written entirely by me from the ground-up in PHP 7.4 starting about over two years ago.

This main branch is the latest commit made to the private repo on August 5th, 2022. The branches contain older versions going as far back as October 2020. There's a large gap between January and August 2021, but that's because I used no version control prior to August. I have a source archive from April 2021, but it's password protected and I don't know what the password is. oops.
 
There's some stuff missing from here (e.g. updated config templates, database structure template, nginx configs) but it's nothing you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself if you're bored enough.

This is purely here for archival purposes. I'd strongly suggest you to **not** use this in a production environment, but I don't really care if you do (oh, and also, if you are, be careful as this is under GPLv3). Besides the specific directory setup and extensions needed, it's not that difficult to get running.

Other than all that, have fun, I guess.
